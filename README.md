This project is a Django REST API for a "Remind-me-later" web app. It allows users to create and list reminders by providing a message, reminder type (SMS or Email), and date/time. The API supports POST requests to create reminders and GET requests to retrieve all reminders. Designed for easy integration with frontend apps, future notification methods can be added.
